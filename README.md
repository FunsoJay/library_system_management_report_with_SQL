# library_system_management_report_with_SQL
## Overview
This repository features SQL queries designed for a library management database. It includes tasks such as creating and managing tables, performing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete), and executing advanced SQL queries, including JOINs. The objective is to demonstrate technical proficiency in database design, manipulation, and querying within the context of a library management system. The dataset encompasses information on books, branches, employees, and members to whom books are issued, among other relevant details.

## Data Source
[Zero Analyst](https://github.com/najirh/Library-System-Management---P2)


## Objectives
- **Design a Library Management System Database**: Build and populate a database with tables for branches, employees, members, books, issued status, and return status. Import the data into SQL for further analysis.
- **Execute CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete actions on the provided data.
- **Use CTAS (Create Table As Select)**: Leverage CTAS to generate new tables based on query results.
- **Craft Advanced SQL Queries**: Create sophisticated queries to analyze and extract specific insights from the library management system data.


## Report
- **Database Schema**: Well defined table structures and relationships between the tables.
- **Data Analysis**: Insights on book categories, employee salary structures, member registration patterns, and book issuance statistics issued dates as well as return dates.
- **Summary Reports**: Consolidated data on popular books and employee performance metrics.

## Conclusion
This project showcases the application of SQL expertise in designing and managing a comprehensive library management system. It encompasses database creation, data manipulation, and advanced querying techniques, offering a robust framework for effective data management and insightful analysis of the library management system.

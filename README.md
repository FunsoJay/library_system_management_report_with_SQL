# library_system_management_report_with_SQL
## Overview
This repository contains SQL queries on a library system and management database. It includes creating and managing tables, performing CRUD operations such as create, update, and executing advanced SQL queries such as JOINs. The goal is to showcase technical skills in designing, manipulation, as well as querying of the library system's database. The dataset includes data on books, branches, employees, members that books are issued to, etc.
